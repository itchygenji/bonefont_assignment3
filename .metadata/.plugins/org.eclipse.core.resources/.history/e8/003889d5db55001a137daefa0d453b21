/*Create class SavingsAccount. Use a static variable annualInterestRate to store the annual interest rate 
 * for all account holders. Each object of the class contains a private instance variable savingsBalance 
 * indicating the amount the saver currently has on deposit. Provide method calculateMonthlyInterest to 
 * calculate the monthly interest by multiplying the savingsBalance by annualInterestRate divided by 12—this 
 * interest should be added to savingsBalance. Provide a static method modifyInterestRate that sets the 
 * annualInterestRate to a new value.

Write a program called SavingsAccountTest to test class SavingsAccount. Instantiate two SavingsAccount objects, 
saver1 and saver2, with balances of $2000.00 and $3000.00, respectively. Set annualInterestRate to 4%, then 
calculate the monthly interest for each of 12 months and print the monthly balances for both savers. Next, set 
the annualInterestRate to 5%, calculate the next month’s interest and print the new balances for both savers.*/
